    <div class="g-item intro">

      

    

    

    
      <div class="g-item g-text ">
    

      <p class="g-body">My conversation with Jay-Z began with O.J.</p>


    </div>

    

    
      <div class="g-item g-text ">
    

      <p class="g-body">When I was a kid growing up in black New Orleans in the 1960s, O.J. Simpson was a god. We imitated his moves, his swagger. We didn’t want to just play like him. We wanted to be him, gorgeous and running in the California sun. We practiced his juking moves in the mirror, our hands too small to hold the ball loosely, the way he did. We even wanted to go to U.S.C., where he led the nation in rushing two years in a row. We were angry when he lost the Heisman Trophy to the white, All-American, clean-cut U.C.L.A. quarterback Gary Beban, known as “The Great One.” We were triumphant when he won it the next year.</p>


    </div>

    

    
      <div class="g-item g-text ">
    

      <p class="g-body">But O.J. was not a perfect hero for young black boys, even though he launched himself from poverty in San Francisco to superstardom. He was racially ambivalent. At a time when other athletes were starting to make their blackness a cause, he was trying to make his a footnote.</p>


    </div>

    

    
      <div class="g-item g-text ">
    

      <p class="g-body">So when I was invited to interview Jay-Z, I wanted to talk about his song “The Story of O.J.,” from his most recent album, “4:44,” in which he quotes the legendary, maybe apocryphal, Simpson line “I’m not black, I’m O.J.”</p>


    </div>

    

    
      <div class="g-item g-text ">
    

      <p class="g-body">I was less engaged by the rapper’s marital troubles or his infamous, caught-on-video 2014 elevator dust-up with his sister-in-law. But I did want to try to understand how, with an $88 million Bel Air mansion a freeway ride from neighborhoods where black people endure with so little, Jay-Z holds onto his younger self — a black man who grew up in the ’70s in the Marcy projects of Brooklyn. It seemed from his new body of work that examining this high-wire act of straddling two places had been stirring more deeply within him — much the way it stirs in me, a Southern black man who grew up revering O.J. and whose own success is infinitely greater than anyone in my early life would have imagined for me.</p>


    </div>

    

    
      <div class="g-item g-text ">
    

      <p class="g-body">What is it about the story of O.J. Simpson that moved us both?</p>


    </div>

    

    
      <div class="g-item g-text ">
    

      <p class="g-body">O.J. must have locked down part of himself when he presented himself as the noncontroversial star who never talked about race, the perfect foil for his fellow football player, Cleveland Browns running back Jim Brown, who seemed more threatening, angry. I had to wonder if the pressure of that denial caused him to explode decades later.</p>


    </div>

    

    
      <div class="g-item g-text ">
    

      <p class="g-body">All of this was on my mind when I met with Jay-Z for two hours in an executive office at The Times this past September. Besides O.J. and racial identity, we talked about his mother’s sexuality, and how he could possibly raise socially aware children who shuttled between mansions: After years of rapping about growing up in the ‘hood, he has produced an album that sounds like a middle-aged black man’s deeply introspective therapy session put to music.</p>

    </div>

    

    
      <div class="g-item g-text ">
    

      <p class="g-body"><span>JAY-Z</span>Thank you.</p>


    </div>

    

    
      <div class="g-item g-text ">
    

      <p class="g-body"><span>BAQUET</span> The things I want to talk to you about: I want to talk a little bit about race. Your music some, too. I thought the song ["<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM7lw0Ovzq0">The Story of O.J.</a>," from the album "<a href="https://listen.tidal.com/album/75413011">4:44</a>," 2017] was particularly powerful. I took the message as, "You can be rich, you can be poor, you're still black." Who were you speaking to? Who did you want to listen to that and be moved by it?</p>


    </div>

    

    
      <div class="g-item g-text ">
    

      <p class="g-body"><span>JAY-Z</span> It's a nuanced song, you know. It's like, I'm specifically speaking to us. And about who we are and how do you maintain the sense of self while pushing it forward and holding us to have a responsibility for our actions. Because in America, it is what it is. And there's a solution for us: If we had a power base together, it would be a much different conversation than me having a conversation by myself and trying to change America by myself. If I come with 40 million people, there's a different conversation, right? It's just how it works. I can effect change and get whomever in office because this many people, we're all on the same page. Right? So the conversation is, like, "I'm not rich, I'm O.J." For us to get in that space and then disconnect from the culture. That's how it starts. This is what happens. And then you know what happens? You're on your own, and you see how that turned out.</p>


    </div>

    

    
      <div class="g-item g-text ">
    

      <p class="g-body"><span>BAQUET</span> Was it a reminder, too, that the thing O.J. forgot, maybe, was that as rich as he was, as entitled as his life was, he was reminded very forcefully when he became a subject of racial debate that he was also a black man, whether he accepted that or not?</p>

      <p class="g-body"><span>JAY-Z</span> That's right. Absolutely. And for us, like I'm saying, to speak to that the point is, "Don't forget that," because that's really not the goal. The goal is not to be successful and famous. That's not the goal. The goal is, if you have a specific God-given ability, is to live your life out through that. One. And two, we have a responsibility to push the conversation forward until we're all equal. Till we're all equal in this place. Because until everyone's free, no one's free, and that's just a fact.</p>

      <div class="g-item g-text ">
    

      <p class="g-body"><span>BAQUET</span> When you're as amazingly successful as you are, your kids will live in a very different world from the world you grew up in. How do you go about making sure that they understand the world you grew up in?</p>

      <div class="g-item g-text ">
    

      <p class="g-body"><span>JAY-Z</span> There's a delicate balance to that, right? Because you have to educate your children on the world as it exists today and how it got to that space, but my child doesn't need the same tools that I needed growing up. I needed certain tools to survive my area that my child doesn't need. They're growing up in a different environment.<sup>1</sup> But also they have to know their history. Have a sense of what it took to get to this place. And have compassion for others. The most important thing I think out of all this is to teach compassion and to identify with everyone's struggle and to know these people made these sacrifices for us to be where we are and to push that forward — for us. I believe that's the most important thing to show them, because they don't have to know things that I knew growing up. Like being tough.</p>

In Jay's verse, he raps: "Took me 26 years just to find my path / My only job is cut the time in half." (Jay-Z's son, Sir, and his twin sister, Rumi, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/14/arts/music/beyonce-twins-photo.html">were born last June</a>. His eldest daughter, Blue Ivy, is 5.)

      <div class="g-item g-text ">
    

      <p class="g-body"><span>BAQUET</span> Do you worry at all that as much as you will teach them history, and as much as you yourself are seen as an important figure among black people in America, that there's something they'll be missing? Or do you think that's silly, [that] in fact they'll have so many advantages that that's too negative of a way to approach it?</p>


    </div>

    

    
      <div class="g-item g-text ">
    

      <p class="g-body"><span>JAY-Z</span> Exactly. Like, they'll be who they are, right? And it's just certain tools that you would hope for your child to have. You know, like, again, fairness and compassion and empathy and a loving heart. And those things translate in any environment. Those are the main base things that you want — well, for me, I would want my child to have. You know? Treat people as they are, no matter who they are, no matter where they sit in the world, not to, like, be super nice to someone at a high position or mean to someone who they've deemed to be below them. I can't buy you love, I can't show it to you. I can show you affection and I can, you know, I can express love, but I can't put it in your hand. I can't put compassion in your hand. I can't show you that. So the most beautiful things are things that are invisible. That's where the important things lie.</p>

      <p class="g-body"><span>BAQUET</span> For me as a black man of a certain age, when I was a kid O.J. Simpson was God. I'm 61, so I was a little kid when he was [around]. Do you expect black people and white people and young people and old people to hear different things in your music? I'm sure I heard some things in that song that you may not even have thought of 'cause I'm a different generation. What do you want a young white kid to hear in that song that maybe a young black kid would not hear?</p>

      <p class="g-body"><span>JAY-Z</span> That's a great question. I think when you make music, you want people to hear different things, and then you want it to start a dialogue. Because that's how we get to understanding. "Oh, you felt that way about it." "This is actually what I meant, because this happened, and these things happened, that led to me saying this specific thing."</p>

      <p class="g-body"><span>JAY-Z</span> I felt it was really hypocritical. Only because it's obvious the song is, like, "Do you want to be rich? Do what people got rich done." Of course, it's a general statement, right? It's obviously a general statement, like the video attached to it was a general statement. And if you didn't have a problem with the general statement I made about black people, and people eating watermelon and things like that [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM7lw0Ovzq0">the animated music video</a> for the song, which references racist cartoons, includes a caricature of a black man eating watermelon] — if <em>that</em> was fine, [but] that line about wealth bothered you, then that's very hypocritical, and, you know, that's something within yourself. 'Cause basically, I was saying, you know, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, is a great basketball player. He trains in the off-season. If you want to be great, train in off-season like him. That's basically the statement. You can't miss the context of the song. You have to be like 5 years old or something.</p>

      <div class="g-item g-text ">
    

      <p class="g-body"><span>BAQUET</span> Some people think that the election of Donald Trump has revived the debate about race in America. Some people think that, in fact, there's always been racism in America; that it hasn't changed and that the debate isn't any different. It's just people are paying attention to it. What do you think?</p>

      <div class="g-item g-text ">
    

      <p class="g-body"><span>JAY-Z</span> Yeah, there was a great Kanye West line in one of [his] songs: "Racism's still alive, they just be concealin' it."

I think when Donald Sterling<sup>3</sup> got kicked out of the N.B.A., I thought it was a misstep, because when you kick someone out, of course he's done wrong, right? But you also send everyone else back in hiding. People talk like that. They talk like that. Let's deal with that.</p>

	<span class="g-annotation-name"><sup>4</sup>Wesley Morris:</span> Ah, Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, whose protest against racism and racial inequality in America might be the most incendiary act of political umbrage since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIUzLpO1kxI">Kanye West declared</a>, at a 2005 national telethon for victims of Hurricane Katrina, that George W. Bush "doesn't care about black people." Kaepernick's decision last year to take a knee during the performance of the national anthem has since been adopted by dozens of other athletes. The president's outrage at the protests and the ensuing debate have upstaged the injustice Kaepernick knelt against. In October, after several months without being signed to a team, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/15/sports/colin-kaepernick-nfl-collusion.html">Kaepernick filed</a> a grievance against the N.F.L. accusing the owners of collusion against him. So there's an apt sting in dedicating "The Story of O.J." to him, since he's now taking a hit for being agreeable, race-blind O.J. Simpson's opposite.

Two, [the N.B.A. has] a great ... they have a great commissioner<sup>5</sup> who's really open. And, you know, supports them. And you feel that.

Silver has merrily ridden for the last two years on the N.B.A. float in New York City's gay pride parade. He oversaw the expulsion of the Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, who could never have remained in the league — his continued presence might have torn it apart. Ridding basketball of Sterling started as many conversations about the sort of open-carry racism we're currently living with as keeping him around would have. One thing that makes Silver a great commissioner is that he understands that.

      <p class="g-body"><span>JAY-Z</span> I grew so much from the experience. But I think the most important thing I got is that everything is connected. Every emotion is connected and it comes from somewhere. And just being aware of it. Being aware of it in everyday life puts you at such a ... you're at such an advantage. You know, you realize that if someone's racist toward you, it ain't about you. It's about their upbringing and what happened to them, and how that led them to this point. You know, most bullies bully. It just happen. Oh, you got bullied as a kid so you trying to bully me. I understand.</p>

Why you looking at me? You looking at me?” And then you realize: “Oh, you think I see you. You’re in this space where you’re hurting, and you think I see you, so you don’t want me to look at you. And you don’t want me to see you.”</p>

So it wasn't as impactful. And two, it wasn't coming from a place where it was as evolved.<sup>8</sup> And it's very difficult. It's hard to hear songs back. It's hard to perform ... songs, but, um, I feel it's the most important work that I've done and I'm very proud of it and the effect that it's having on people. Even like the studio sessions, you know, we were having four-hour conversations after playing one song. I learned so much about people that was around me, just my friends, I learned things about them that I didn't know, in a 20-year relationship, just from this one song. So I knew it would have that sort of impact beyond myself. It's my responsibility as an artist to go to these places.</p>

He spent most of 2013's "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/37uqAKt9dLsLob7yomDWY4">Magna Carta Holy Grail</a>" both admiring his wealth and wielding it. Being a rich black rapper had put him on the defensive when his strongest creative mode involves the moral costs and social perks of his being self-made. One of the most poignant aspects of the new album is the way he's trying to reconcile what affluence means for him, his family and his race.

	<span class="g-annotation-name"><sup>11</sup>Wesley Morris:</span> I'm a sucker for mommy music. The third track on "4:44" — "Smile" — features Jay-Z's mother, Gloria Carter, and contains this couplet about her: "Momma had four kids, but she's a lesbian / Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian." His rapping here is buttery and exuberant: "I just wanna see you smile through all the hate / Marie Antoinette, baby, let 'em eat cake." So his approach to Gloria manages to exult her and, for anybody annoyed by his "eat the cake, Anna Mae" line on Beyoncé's 2013 track "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6jG2YzhxptolDzLHTGLt7S">Drunk in Love</a>," arguably to exonerate him from having cast himself as Ike Turner to Beyoncé's Tina. Anyway, "Smile" ends with an inspirational poem that Gloria wrote and recites and that puts the concept of shadows to moving metaphorical use: "The world is changing and they say it's time to be free / But you live with the fear of just being me / Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be / No harm for them, no harm for me / But life is short, and it's time to be free / Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed / Smile."

If that's chapter one of the autobiography, chapter two of the autobiography — I'm oversimplifying — is like, "Now I'm really rich. I have a lot of stuff. Let me tell you how cool that is." And then chapter three of the autobiography is, "Oh my god, I've run myself into the ground." So what's chapter four?</p>

It's humbling; at the same time it's like, you know, it's what you've been charged with in life. And I believe since the beginning of time the poets have been charged with that.

<div class="g-annotation-body">
	<span class="g-annotation-name"><sup>13</sup>Wesley Morris:</span> It's an allusion to a saga. Together, Jay-Z and Kanye West made the 2011 album "Watch the Throne," which reached an apogee of rap collaboration. The story goes that last year, Jay-Z, through his partnership with Live Nation, gave West $20 million as part of his contract to cover expenses for his Saint Pablo tour. Then, from the stage of that tour in Sacramento, West embarked on a tirade that included shots at, among others, Beyoncé, Mark Zuckerberg and, yes, Jay-Z: "I've been sent here to give y'all my truth even at the risk of my own life, even at the risk of my own success, my own career. ... Jay-Z — call me, brah. You still ain't called me. ... Jay-Z, I know you got killers. Please don't send 'em at my head. Just call me. Talk to me like a man." He eventually ended the concert after four songs and, two days later, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/arts/music/kanye-west-hospitalized-exhaustion.html">checked himself into a hospital</a> for an eight-day stay. So, in response, Jay-Z opens "4:44" with "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQLVU4j7Ejo">Kill Jay-Z</a>," nearly three minutes of second-person self-laceration. "You ain't a saint / This ain't KumbaYe," Jay-Z raps. "But you got hurt because you did cool by Ye / You gave him $20 without blinking / He gave you 20 minutes on stage / [What] was he thinkin'?" I've been interpreting this as Jay-Z realizing the usefulness of the old business credo advising against mixing business with friendship and blaming himself for ignoring it.

      <p class="g-body"><span>JAY-Z</span> 'Cause, you know — Kanye came into this business on my label. So I've always been like his big brother. And we're both entertainers. It's always been like a little underlying competition with your big brother. And we both love and respect each other's art, too. So it's like, we both — everyone wants to be the greatest in the world. You know what I'm saying? And then there's like a lot of other factors that play in it.

In the long relationship, you know, hopefully when we're 89 we look at this six months or whatever time and we laugh at that. You know what I'm saying? There's gonna be complications in the relationship that we have to get through. And the only way to get through that is we sit down and have a dialogue and say, "These are the things that I'm uncomfortable with. These are the things that are unacceptable to me. This is what I feel." I'm sure he feels that I've done things to him as well. You know what I'm saying? These are — I'm not a perfect human being by no stretch. You know.</p>

Unless you're <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/nas">Nas</a>, and you like, well-read<sup>14</sup>... — like, he was way more advanced with the album that he wrote. So I just grew up a different way. But [West is] a very compassionate person. And a lot of times he get in trouble trying to help others. So I can identify with it. It's just that there's certain things that happened that's not really acceptable to me.</p>

      <p class="g-body"><span>BAQUET</span> I'm trying to picture the scene when you and your wife both talked about making these very confessional, open albums. Was it difficult to say: "I'm gonna talk about the problems in our marriage. I'm gonna talk about how we almost lost things." And for her to say: "I'm gonna talk about my pain and anger at you." What were those conversations like?</p>

      <div class="g-item g-text ">

So her album came out as opposed to the joint album that we were working on. Um, we still have a lot of that music. And this is what it became. There was never a point where it was like, “I’m making this album.” I was right there the entire time.</p>

      <div class="g-item g-text ">
