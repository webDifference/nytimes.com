    As a local news person, I am looking forward to the podcast.  I enjoy reading the Times, so I think it will resonate the stories but, delivered for the ear.  I do wonder if there will be identifiable &quot;sections&quot; or just a series of connected stories, like NPR.   I also wonder if it will contain actualities.  I look forward to supplementing my menu of listening next to AP, NPR, Civics101 and others.
